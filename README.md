# Sentiment-analysis-using-NLP
Digital media represents a huge opportunity for businesses of any type to capture the opinions, needs and intent that users share on social media. In fact, the number of Google searches, WhatsApp messages and emails sent in 60 seconds is truly impressive.
Truly listening to a customerâ€™s voice requires deeply understanding what they have expressed in natural language: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the best way to understand the language used and uncover the sentiment behind it.
People often consider sentiment (in terms of positive or negative) as the most significant value of the opinions users express via social media. However, in reality emotions provide a richer set of information that address consumer choices and,in many cases, even determines their decisions. Because of this, Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis focused on emotions is extremely useful.
NLP for speech analysis, combined with a powerful social media monitoring strategy, organizations can understand customer reactions and act accordingly to improve customer experience, quickly resolve customer issues and change their market position.
